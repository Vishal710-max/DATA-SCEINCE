"""Pandas support four types of Multi-axes indexing they are: 
Dataframe.[ ] ; This function also known as indexing operator 
Dataframe.loc[ ] : This function is used for labels. 
Dataframe.iloc[ ] : This function is used for positions or integer based 
Dataframe.ix[] : This function is used for both label and integer based"""

#simple program to print the data from  .csv file

#small splling mistake can create some errors like invalid file\Folder name or any filed name from that file
#Example: Selecting a single columns *******

#Indexing a DataFrame using .loc[ ]
# Example: Selecting a single row 
# In order to select a single row using .loc[] , we put a single row label in a .loc function.

# As shown in the output image, two series were returned since there was only one parameter both of the times.

# Example:Selecting multiple rows 
# In order to select multiple rows, we put all the row labels in a list and pass that to .loc function.

# Example:Selecting two rows and three columns 
# In order to select two rows and three columns, we select a two rows which we want 
# to select and three columns and put it in a separate list like this: 
# Dataframe.loc[["row1", "row2"], ["column1", "column2", "column3"]] thes sequance is important if we change the seq. 
# that means interchanging the position of row and column the error will be occur

# Example:Selecting all of the rows and some columns 
# In order to select all of the rows and some columns, we use single colon [:] to select 
# all of rows and list of some columns which we want to select like this: 
# Dataframe.loc[:, ["column1", "column2", "column3"]]

# Indexing a DataFrame using .iloc[ ] : 
# This function allows us to retrieve rows and columns by position. In order to do that, 
# weâ€™ll need to specify the positions of the rows that we want, and the positions of the columns that we want as well. 
# The df.iloc indexer is very similar to df.loc but only uses integer locations to make its selections. 
# basic diff between the iloc and loc method is in .loc[] method we can pass the row or column name but in .iloc[] we can pass the index value of row or column

# Example:Selecting a single row by using the iloc method
import pandas as pd 
data = pd.read_csv("nba.csv", index_col ="Name") 
# retrieving rows by iloc method 
row2 = data.iloc[3] 
print(row2) 

#Example:Selecting multiple rows

# making data frame from csv file 
data = pd.read_csv("nba.csv", index_col ="Name") 
# retrieving multiple rows by iloc method 
row2 = data.iloc [[3, 5, 7]] 
print(row2) 

# Example:Selecting two rows and two columns 
# In order to select two rows and two columns, we create a list of 2 integer for rows 
# and list of 2 integer for columns then pass to a .iloc[] function. 
import pandas as pd 
data = pd.read_csv("nba.csv", index_col ="Name") 
# retrieving two rows and two columns by iloc method 
row2 = data.iloc [[3, 4], [1, 2]]

data = pd.read_csv("nba.csv", index_col ="Name") 
# retrieving all rows and some columns by iloc method 
row2 = data.iloc [:, [1, 2]]

#Indexing a using Dataframe.ix[ ] :
#it is an old version which can perform or not on the current computer
import pandas as pd
